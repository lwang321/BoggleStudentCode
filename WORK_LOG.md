| Jan 9  | 10-11am | I started my boggle code by copying over the tst from textcompressor and modifying it to return two different values based on whether the node i'm at is not a word or doesn't exist. This way I can differentiate that my dfs, which is important because that determines whether or not I return out of that call of dfs(). The rest of the algorithm is pretty simple: use depth first search to go through the board, using a TST to see if the given string is a word or not. Right now I'm using tst.lookup() but I hope to change to node lookups later for better efficiency once I figure it out with normal .lookup(). Right now I have testEdgeCase done, but nothing else is right. I think there's something wrong with how I go between test cases, because some cases work on their own but break down when run together. |

Then, I looked into my code for TST and realized that I should only do the n.code == 0 check if I'm at the very end of the search, which only happens in the else{} part of the function. By doing this, I was skipping over a bunch of searches and returning false early. I got all test cases working now. |
